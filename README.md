# Convolutional-Neural-Networks

PART-1
Train a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify CIFAR images using the
Keras Sequential API. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 color images in 10
classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test
images. The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with
10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from
each class. The training batches contain the remaining images in random order, but
some training batches may contain more images from one class than another. Between
them, the training batches contain exactly 5000 images from each class.

PART-2
Train and test a LeNet-5 CNN to classify traffic signs. A user can upload a photo of a
traffic sign and predict the class. The dataset was taken from the German Traffic Sign
Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) and was presented for the first time at the
single-image classification challenge at the International Joint conference on Neural
Networks (IJCNN) 2011. It was created from about 10 hours of video recorded while
driving on different roads in Germany during the Daytime. The Data consists of about
40,000 real colorful photos of traffic signs.
